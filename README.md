# Travis County Election Predictions

Analysis on the 2018 election for Travis County, Texas

## Problem
Travis county is one of the fastest growing counties in the nation. Can we accurately predict the latest election with the signifcant demographics changes that have occurred?


## Data

Travis County has voter data and history available on the County Clerks site for all 750,000 registered voters. I download the dataset and attempted to import into a notebook. Using pandas to import the csv but using the `engine='python'` actually was the most effective way of getting into a dataframe.
